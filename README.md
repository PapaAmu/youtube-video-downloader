I am really strugglin watching videos on youtube because I constantly experience loadshedding impacts. 
So since now I have decided to build a youtube downloader program so I can download videos and watch them on 
other devices while I am online. This is part of me learning how to code, because I my goal is to learn as much
as I can manage.... More specially with Python language, I really love it because it it easy to learn.
